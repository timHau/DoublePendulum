This project leverages [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal), Apples GPU-accelerated graphics API, to render a double pendulum fractal map.
Double pendulum fractals are intricate and beautiful patterns generated by simulating chaotic double pendulum motion and visualizing points of stability and chaos.

## Details

A double Pendulum is a physical system consisting of two pendulums attached to each other.
The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic in nature.

There is no closed form solutions for $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ as functions of time, but it is possible to numerically solve for them
using the [Runge Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) method.

## Getting Started
